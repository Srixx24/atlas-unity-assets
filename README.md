# Feature Explanations:
This program is meant to help developers access and edit databases and items within. It features a main database manager with easy access to potions, weapons, and armor databases. Within those, a create item function allows full customization of the items. The packages hierarchy allows the databases to communicate with the database manager and the create items scripts communicate with the base create item script.in using a system like this it keeps the code clean and easy to run. Below are some examples of functions.
